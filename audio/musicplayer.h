/*
This class handles loading and playing sets of music.
The filenames of the music files are stored in a config file.
You can also optionally shuffle the order of the music.
Once playing, it will continually loop through the entire set of music.
    It will only stop when calling stop() or pause().

To use this class, you can simply create a MusicPlayer object,
    and load a config file with a list of filenames to music files.
    Then, you can call the start() function with the name of the set
    of music to play in the config file.

Example usage:
#include "musicplayer.h"
MusicPlayer music("music.cfg");
music.start("coolSet");

Example music.cfg file:
    volume = 70
    shuffle = true
    [Music]
    coolSet = {
        "someTrack.ogg",
        "anotherTrack.ogg"
    }

TODO:
    Use a thread or future async thing or something to get rid of the update function
    Handle loading filenames from other sources besides config files
    Support audio spatialization
